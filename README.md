A blank repository to complete the Pokeverse Assignment during Front End Module 2.1 Weeks 1-4.

  ## Pokeverse UI
Over the next few weeks we’ll be building a digital Pokemon (simplified) card game. Complete with features like:
- Viewing and searching Pokemon “cards”
- Viewing and comparing stats
- Adding Pokemon cards to a deck
- Opportunities for you to expand functionality like dueling 2 Pokemon against each other.

We’ll be adding a new feature to this project each week, with each new thing we learn. Feel free to experiment with components, colors, typography, interactions, responsiveness, etc. This is all about learning, not making a polished product.

## Design

|||info
**To get the original 150 pokemon, call the PokeAPI endpoint https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151 from within your app!**

A wireframe is provided below.

Recall that a wireframe is a low fidelity sketch of the design. Your implementation should not have 18 Pikachus, it should have the 151 original Pokemon. You should work with your chosen UI framework (see guidance below) to make the design functional, attractive and accessible. Have fun with the features and consider what we've learned about effective UI.

## Guidance for Your Stack
It is intended that you will work with a front-end framework which corresponds to what you use at work, so that you are practicing skills that will help you on-the-job.

There might not be an obvious choice for you, but almost every company has some kind of UI work going on, so you might need to ask a few people to find out what gets used. Maybe they don't use a framework yet, but are looking to move into something in the future - it's a great chance for you to get ahead and perhaps lead the way! If there really is no clear choice, feel free to fall back to the default of React with MUI.

Here's a list of UI frameworks with popular CSS/component libraries:

| UI Framework | Component / CSS libraries |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| **[React](https://react.dev/)** <br>Developed by Facebook, React is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based approach and enables developers to build reusable UI components. | [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)<br> [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)<br> [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) |
| **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** <br>Developed by Google, Angular is a TypeScript-based framework for building web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features for creating complex and scalable UIs. | [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)<br>[PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/)<br>[NGX-Bootstrap](https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/)<br> |
| **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** <br> Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that allows developers to build user interfaces incrementally. It is known for its simplicity and ease of integration with existing projects. | [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) <br>[Element UI](https://element-plus.org/en-US/)<br>[Bootstrap Vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) |
| **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**<br>Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It differs from other popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js in how it approaches the rendering of components. | [Material UI](https://sveltematerialui.com/)<br> [Svelte UI](https://www.svelteui.org/)<br>[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)**<br>Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms. It uses a single codebase to create visually appealing and performant user interfaces. | [Material Design](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/material)<br>[Cupertino](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/cupertino) |
| Vanilla<br> No framework required! Just use simple HTML / CSS / JS to build your UI | [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)<br>[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) |
